  { "name":"Bluefire",  "description":"Iâ€™m a European dragon with a scaly charcoal-black/dark blue skin and glowing deep blue eyes. Horns along the back follow slightly its curvature until the tail, where they become more rounded and point upwards. The horns on my head point straight backwards. I have a tiny horn on my nose, too! Due to the sharp contrast between the horns/teeth/claws and his skin, they appear very white. The inside of my wings are grey, with my plated belly being the same colour.", "coordinates":[50.9545423, 5.9075412], "approximation": 2000 }

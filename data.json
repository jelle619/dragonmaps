Horns along the back follow slightly its curvature until the tail, where they become more rounded and point upwards. The horns on my head point straight backwards. I have a tiny horn on my nose, too! Due to the sharp contrast between the horns/teeth/claws and his skin, they appear very white. The inside of my wings are grey, with my plated belly being the same colour.", "coordinates":[50.9545423, 5.9075412], "approximation": 5000, "links":{"Discord":"https://discord.com/users/154498873006620672", "Telegram":"https://t.me/jelle619", "Website":"https://bluefi.re"} },
  { "avatar":"aucklington.webp", "color":"blue", "name":"Aucklington",  "description":"Hey! My name is Aucklington, nice to meet you. I'm a rather short sand cat, about 1.50m tall and as lazy as any cat could be. I have a light beige coat all over with 2 light brown stripes on each ear and olive coloured eyes. I enjoy talking to almost anyone who wants to chat about whatever they want, and aside from talking my main pastimes are cooking and anything I can do in nature. I may not be a dragon or a kin, as I consider myself a furry and my cat a character, but I've always felt at home around dragons and love their company. One of the most important things in life to me is to learn and expand my views on as much as I can, more than anything with the mind and spirituality and I find myself most at home with kin as a result. Feel free to contact me anytime if you want, I'd always love to chat!", "coordinates":[44.596318053868615, -79.441106722284], "approximation": 500, "links":{"Discord":"https://discord.com/users/383705503416451084", "Telegram":"https://t.me/Aucklington"} }
